# Space-Cats
Final C++ project (group)

Space-Cats was the final project for our object-oriented programming course. The game is relatively simple, utilizing glut and Microsoft's Visual Studio environment. The game resembles the classic 'dog-fighting' arcade games involving waves of differing enemies for the player to overcome. It features upgrades for the players, increasing difficulty from the enemies, and also aesthetically pleasing effects like randomizing the color of projectiles fired by the player ship.

This project was one of the first major group projects that encouraged constant extra-curricular communication, planning, and programming. We succeeded in making exactly what we wanted by experimenting and learning how to divy up project tasks, set realistic deadlines, and ensuring we could make ourselves available to help each other.
